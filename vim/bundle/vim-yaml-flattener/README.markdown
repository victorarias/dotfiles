# YAML flattener plugin for Vim

Vim plugin to toggle a YAML file buffer from nested format

    en:
      foo:
        bar: "baare"
      baz: "baize"

to a flat format

    en.foo.bar: "baare"
    en.baz: "baize"

and back again.

This is handy with Ruby on Rails .yml translation files.
Convert them to flat format to search and edit more easily, then back to nested format for compatibility with Rails i18n and other tools.

Just open a YAML file and hit `<leader>r` (MacVim also supports `⌘r`). Again to go back.

Based on my [YAMLator lib](https://gist.github.com/293581).

## Caveats

Keys will be sorted on each conversion. You might consider this a feature – convert the file twice to sort it.

Any comments in the beginning of the file are kept, but inline comments are lost.
